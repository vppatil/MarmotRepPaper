Discussion outline

I. not obligate biennial breeders- none of the hypotheses were supported.

II. Evolved constraints
- would have expected strong prev. breeding state effect- 

The fact that we were able to accurately predict the number of litters produced in 2007-2009 using models that were parameterized with data from 1999-2004 suggests that breeding probability are also relatively consistent over time, even though environmental conditions and social group composition are not  (Table 5).
