Marmot paper 2 figure notes

Figure 1.
Psi -probability of movement into the breeding group in the current year, given previous state

- take homes
1) Big difference between first-year breeders and older marmots- not too surprising
2) no detectable differences between older marmots that bred last year and those that didn't
3) Probability of breeding for older marmots was stable- around 50 %
4) probability of breeding for first timers was more variable, around 20-25%

Figure 2. -apparent survival probability across years for breeders and non-breeders

Take home message
- accelerating decline in survivorship for adult females over the course of the study period
- significantly lower survival probability by the final years
- estimates are contingent on assuming that survivorship is constant.
- no difference between breeder and non-breeder females
- note that this means they bred during the first season in each interval.

Breeder/non-breeder not explicitly defined here- maybe put in the figure legend just in case.

Figure 3. Body condition index for Breeders vs. non breeders (females)
- note that there is a significant difference in slope between the two
- maybe that could be added in
- julian day 140 - 240 reflects may 20 to august 28, approximately

take home- lots of noise- but by end of growing season non-breeders are significantly heavier proportional to skeletal traits
interpretation is that they are in significantly better body condition
