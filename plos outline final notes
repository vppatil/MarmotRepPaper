look over explanation of breeding effort detection.

Intro hypotheses

biennial breeding

under evolved constraint- no annual breeding, and if there is, a heavy fitness cost.

so look for fitness costs associated with frequent breeding.

Ecological constraints- you only skip years when you can't afford to breed.

social constraint-s- reproductive suppression- 
- lower averge prob of breeding as the number of mature females increases.- also decreased breeding probability for younger females

so the focus is on breeding probability.

survival, other stuff is to determine whether the processes that govern breeding probability also influence other reproductive life history traits.

make sure the allee effects bit is in there.

OK- now the discussion paragraphs

I. overview
	-hypotheses not supported
II. Evolved constraints
	- there was biennial breeding, but also annual
	- influence of breeding state on current breed effort was negligible
	- old literature didn't use robust methods

	-50%breeding prob does suggest some level of intrinsic constraint- or it could just be random.

III. Ecological constraints
	- no evidence for environmenal (climate) effects
	- we also know that food availability doesn't affect survival
	- surprising- other marmot species show these kinds of effects
	- also- other demographic parameters, particularly survival, are sensitive
	- may reflect a life history tradeoff to compensate for environmentally induced mortality.
	- however, hard to really understand the importance of environmentally influenced variation in demographic rates without considering the importance of those demographic rates for overall population dynamics.
	- sensitivity too- parameters with highest sensitivity for population growth tend to be those that are most stable.

	

IV. Social Constraints
	- mating system is flexible, so dominant positions may be less entrenched.

V. Comparison with other marmot species.
