ipod discussion notes


Say breed prob is consistent over time, as evidenced by...

-done.

Ecol constraints para:

Explain and cite life history tradeff
link fecundity trade off with data

Cost of rep para:
Explicitly link pdo snow conclusions with previous literature

Marmot comparisons:

Mention that marmot gradient is not evenly studied, hoary marmots are close to being an end member.

Make it clear that eco constraints may be sufficient to explain inter species, maybe inter site scale differences- clarify scale of comparison.

para 2- link climate and ecol constraints, rework wording

change less to weakly- etc. remove qualitative comparisons.

Table notes

PDO lag subscript
Age- two age classes
Mother Age- minimum mother age in 
Group
Ad. fems
Time
Brd. State
1

Is it clear that it's just females?

Table 2 should be landscape
poisson overdispersion
juvs per group- used negative binomial, no random effects
juvs/female- poisson, social group/social group * pdo random effects
litter size- gaussian.

Table 3.
Pdo + PDOlag, psi age
group effects on psi were supported. survival- brd. state 1.75 delta aic from top model.

Basically- strong pdo effect for survival
Age effet strongest for psi- weaker support for group, breeding state.

Table 4 summed aic weights
For S- pdo, breeding state much weaker

Psi- age universal- breeding state next, then group size.

Table 5. -the early model did a decent job predicting number of breeding females in the later dataset.

Table 6- model selection results for juvs/group, juvs/female
checking to see if there is evidence for reproductive suppression, individual breeding effort differences.

group size (number of non-juveniles in the fall, right?)
jper group. strong group effect, weaker climate effect.
jperfemale
-climate effect was strongest, group was weaker. 

jpergroup- positive effect of group size- more adults, the more babies produced.
but not more babies per female

negative pdo effect- fewer babies on crappy, early snowmelt years. More babies with previous pdolag positive- longer growing season.
